  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>A hearty thai curry that is milder on the spiciness level than most of its counterparts. The curry paste can be
    homemade, but that would require a lot more harder ingredients that are typically harder to get than simply buying
    the premade paste.</p>

    <li>Coconut milk</li>
    <li>jasmine/fragrant white rice</li>

    <li>Meat or Tofu</li>
    <li>Fried Peanuts</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>

    <li>Cube potatos into slightly larger than bite-sized pieces</li>

    <li>Cook your proteins separately to a slightly undercooked level and remove from pan</li>
    <li>Add curry paste, and water into deep pan</li>
    <li>Add coconut milk to desired sweetness, mildness, and consistency</li>
    <li>Toss in potatos</li>
    <li>Simmer sauce and potatos on low heat until potatos are soft and easy to pierce with a fork</li>
    <li>Add in your partially cooked proteins to the sauce</li>
    <li>Continue to simmer for a few more minutes until proteins are properly cooked</li>
